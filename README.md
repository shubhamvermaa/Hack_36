# Introduction
Our project aims to create a sustainable Road Planning system which aims to check the effectiveness of a traffic network and distributes the traffic in a such a way that it takes into effect the number of cars in the road and displays the most opitmum path for the next vehicle . The project is based on the phenomenon of Braess's paradox which states  that adding a path in a road oriented graph to improve traffic flow can, in some case, slow down traffic and has the reverse effect. We treated this problem by checking the effect of a car on the road network. For this we fetch some values from a dataset to track the number of vehicles at an instant and then interpolate that data to predict the effect on next vehicle. This helps us properly manage traffic in a network and allows us to reduce traffic. This can also be used in collective mind network like self driving cars to create a effecient system.
